## Proposed Methodology/System

We are using the **Agile methodology** with an **iterative and incremental approach** for the development of the Automated Menu Ordering System. This ensures user feedback, continuous testing, and improvement throughout the process.

### Key Steps

1. **Define Scope and Requirements**: Clearly outline project goals, gather requirements, and create user stories and use cases.
2. **Plan the Product**: Develop a product roadmap and prioritize features based on importance.
3. **Brainstorm Ideas**: Collaborate on ideas, features, and design concepts to shape the product.
4. **Develop in Cycles**: Build the product in short iterations, focusing on delivering essential features first.
5. **Deliver the Product**: Release versions of the product in stages, gather feedback, and refine accordingly.
6. **Review Incrementally**: Evaluate each product increment, collect feedback, and adjust for the next iteration.
7. **Plan the Next Iteration**: Use feedback and new requirements to plan upcoming development cycles.
8. **Ensure Product Acceptance**: Verify that the product aligns with user needs and expectations.
9. **Release the Final Product**: Launch the completed product to users, ensuring it meets all requirements.

### Ziosk Tabletop Tablets

Ziosk tabletop tablets are used in restaurants to provide customers with digital menus, ordering, and payment options. Customers can browse the menu, customize their orders, and pay directly from the tablet. This system has been successful in improving order accuracy, reducing wait times, and increasing customer satisfaction[^10][^11].

### McDonald’s Self-Service Kiosks

Offers self-service kiosks for ordering food. Customers can browse the menu, customize their orders, and pay directly at the kiosk. This system has improved order accuracy and reduced wait times for customers. Though they are usually positioned in the restaurant rather than at tables[^12].

### Chili’s Grill & Bar

Offers a tablet-based ordering system for customers. The system allows customers to browse the menu, place orders, and pay directly from the tablet. This company has seen increased customer satisfaction and faster service times with this technology. Our system is also inspired by this concept of digital ordering[^13].

## Data Gathering Approach

### First-hand Experience

- Restaurants will be visited to observe current systems.
- Managers and staff will be consulted to understand challenges.
- Notes will be taken on tools or software used for managing operations.

### Surveys and Interviews

- Surveys will be created for restaurant owners, staff, and customers to gather perspectives.
- Customer feedback surveys will be used to identify common preferences and complaints related to service, timing, and technology.

### Secondary Research

- Existing systems and case studies on restaurant management technologies will be analyzed.
- Software solutions, their features, and reviews will be examined to identify areas for improvement.

### Observation and Testing

- On-site tests will be conducted to assess system efficiency and document bottlenecks.
- Observations will be made during peak and off-peak hours to capture activity levels.

### Competitive Analysis

- Restaurants that have successfully implemented technology will be compared.
- Tools such as mobile apps and online reservation systems will be analyzed to inform solution design.

### User Feedback and Iterative Development

- Feedback loops will be established with staff and customers during prototyping.
- Ongoing feedback will guide solution design and functionality improvements.
