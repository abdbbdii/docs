## Abstract

The Automated Menu Ordering System solves issues like long wait times, order mistakes, and reliance on waitstaff by allowing customers to select tables, browse menus, and place orders directly from a table screen. Customer can pay for their food. A manager oversees order fulfillment and overall restaurant operations, while an admin manages the menu, promotional deals, accounts, and branches.

## Introduction

Many restaurants struggle with long wait times, order errors due to human intervention, and high labor costs, which can negatively impact customer satisfaction and overall efficiency. The reliance on waitstaff for taking orders can lead to delays and mistakes, affecting the dining experience.

The Automated Menu Ordering System addresses these challenges by providing several advantages. It eliminates the need for waitstaff, allowing customers to sit at a table and start browsing the menu using a screen at their table, where they can place orders directly. Customers can customize their orders, view the status of their orders, and pay for their meals through the system. This automated process reduces wait times, minimizes order errors, and enhances the overall dining experience.

The platform includes various functionalities, such as a comprehensive menu display that allows customers to view food items, read descriptions, and check prices. The system enables customers to customize their orders based on preferences, such as portion sizes or ingredient modifications.

The manager oversees order fulfillment and overall restaurant operations, ensuring smooth kitchen functionality and addressing any service issues. Meanwhile, the admin manages the menu and promotional deals, with the ability to update or modify items as necessary to provide customers with the latest offerings. Both the manager and admin must sign up and log in, ensuring secure access and control over their respective areas.
